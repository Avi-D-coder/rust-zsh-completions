These completions are generated by `rustup`.
I have created this repository to use them with a zsh plugin manager.
I use https://github.com/jedahan/zr to manage my zsh plugins, but you can use any other plugin manager.

To regenerate completions, run:
```sh
rustup completions zsh cargo > ./_cargo
rustup completions zsh > ./_rustup
```
